## Overview
This is my first custom synthesizer! It's a digital mono synth based off of the Daisy Seed microcontroller. This was mostly completed while I was in school, so it's very much a first project. Despite being so basic, it was featured in the Electrosmith newsletter!

It's shoddily written in C++ using the Daisy libraries to build off of. I designed and ordered a custom purple PCB from PCBWay, designed in KiCad. 

## Features
- All Digital!
- Single voice containing an oscillator and sub-oscillator!
- Filters!
- Effects!
- A mappable LFO!
- Sparkly 3D Printed Enclosure!

## Source Code

Code is awful, it was my first time using C++ and the daisy library. Please excuse it and don't use it as reference. 

I believe I've lost all my KiCad files, so please don't go looking for those.
