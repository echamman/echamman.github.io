## Overview
The Ouroboros is a custom guitar pedal based on the Daisy Seed. The idea is to be a delay and reverb unit with some analog drive. The 'self eating' portion (from the name) comes from it having an extra input and output jack. You can send your guitar signal out of the pedal into other effects, then return the signal to be delayed. The result is you have a 'dry' signal coming out of the pedal, and all of your delays have effects applied to them. 

Project is incomplete - ETA: TBD
