## Overview
I'm Ethan, I'm a developer and tinkerer with a focus on audio projects! The picture at the top of the website is my cat Finneas, you'll see him pop up on my profiles.

This website is to document my ongoing projects. You can find overviews of these in the top right under 'Projects'. 

At the bottom you'll find my links. GitHub and LinkedIn for my more professional outputs. Pixelfed is where I post my pictures. Youtube has my HW demo(s), and the music icon is my other youtube where I've posted some jams. 

## Audio Projects
I started my electronics career by building guitar pedals. They can be simple or complex, and you can never build too many! I will try to post some to this site. 

After moving on from pedals, I designed and built a MonoSynth called the DD22 (Digital Daisy). I also started on a custom Daisy-based pedal called the Ouroboros, and I'm now on to building a Fender Princeton Reverb! 

## Photos
Pixelfed is for all of my pictures. I shoot digital on my Fuji X-T2, and analog on a few cameras I've inherited: my favourites being the Canon A1 for 35mm and a Rolleiflex 3.5E for 120mm. 

I usually shoot my hikes, but sometimes I explore my neighbourhood and surrounding areas. 

## Music
I've only posted a few jams on youtube, nothing official. I've focused mainly on guitar at home but I also have some synths I like to noodle on.
