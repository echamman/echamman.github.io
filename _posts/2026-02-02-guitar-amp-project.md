My 2026 project is to build a guitar amp, a Fender Blackface Princeton Reverb specifically!

I've been planning since about December on how to go about building this, I want to build it right. I've been using [this page](https://robrobinette.com/AA1164_Princeton_Reverb.htm) to plan my build. Rob has tons of info on the amp, including a BOM. 

So far I've ordered all of the electronics and the chassis. I plan to do the cabinet later with the help of people who seem to know what they're doing. I've managed to order >90% of the parts from Canadian suppliers!

Here's the chassis:

I've also received the wire. I ordered 5' of each color which I now feel is probably not enough. It also cost me way too much! I wanted the cloth covered tinned wire for authenticity, not sure if it's worth it..

I'll post again when I receive more parts
